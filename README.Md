# NCDHHS Waste water tracking for COVID-19

Putting these data in a somewhat nicer format for later analysis.
This project contains some code to break the data free from the proprietary Tableau formats into csv files which can be used for analysis.

## Purpose

I'm interested in the quantitative waste water data for COVID-19.
While the CDC provides information on the trends, they don't give you the details which are far more important for epidemiological modelling and analysis.
